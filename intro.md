# Curious OCaml

*Curious OCaml* invites you to explore programming through the lens of types, logic, and algebra. OCaml is a language that rewards curiosity—its type system catches errors before your code runs, its functional style encourages clear thinking about data transformations, and its mathematical foundations reveal deep connections between programming and logic. Whether you're new to programming, experienced with OCaml, or a seasoned developer discovering functional programming for the first time, this book aims to spark that "aha!" moment when abstract concepts click into place.

This book is intended for three audiences:

- New to programming: ambitious students in areas with formal rigor -- math, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, etc.
- Intermediate: OCaml programmers.
- Advanced: programmers who are new to functional programming.
