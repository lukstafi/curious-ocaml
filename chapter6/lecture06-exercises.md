* Recall how we generated all subsequences of a list. Find (i.e. generate) 
  all:
  1. permutations of a list;
  1. ways of choosing without repetition from a list;
  1. combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list.
* Using folding for the `expression` data type, compute the degree of the 
  corresponding polynomial. See 
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree\_of\_a\_polynomial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial).
* Implement simplification of expressions using mapping for the `expression` 
  data type.
* Express in terms of `fold_left` or `fold_right`:
  1. indexed : 'a list -> (int \* 'a) list, which pairs elements with 
     their indices in the list;
  1. \* `concat_fold`, as used in the solution of *Honey Islands* puzzle:
     * let rec concatfold f a = function  | [] -> [a]  | x::xs ->     
       f x a |-> (fun a' -> concatfold f a' xs)
     * Hint – consider the function:let rec concatfoldl f a = function  | 
       [] -> a  | x::xs -> concatfoldl f (concatmap (f x) a) xs
  1. run-length encoding of a list (exercise 10 from *99 Problems*).
     * `encode [‘a;‘a;‘a;‘a;‘b;‘c;‘c;‘a;‘a;‘d] = [4,‘a; 1,‘b; 2,‘c; 2,‘a; 
       1,‘d]`
* 
  1. Write a more efficient variant of `list_diff` that computes the 
     difference of sets represented as sorted lists.
  1. `is_unique` in the provided code takes quadratic time – optimize it.
* Write functions `compose` and `perform` that take a list of functions and 
  return their composition, i.e. a function `compose [f1; …; fn] = x 
  ↦ f1 (… (fn x)…)` and `perform [f1; …; fn] = x 
  ↦ fn (… (f1 x)…)`.
* Write a solver for the *Tents Puzzle* 
  [http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/tents-puzzle.html](http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/tents-puzzle.html).
* \* **Robot Squad**. We are given a map of terrain with empty spaces and 
  walls, and lidar readings for multiple robots, 8 readings of the distance to 
  wall or another robot, for each robot. Robots are equipped with compasses, 
  the lidar readings are in directions E, NE, N, NW, W,  SW, S, SE. Determine 
  the possible positions of robots.
* \* Write a solver for the *Plinx Puzzle* 
  [http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/plinx-puzzle.html](http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/plinx-puzzle.html). 
  It does not need to always return correct solutions but it should correctly 
  solve the initial levels from the game.
